# SPA: series SPA2021

There are currently 49 data files.


## Format
The format is originally from the [OR library](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/sppinfo.html) extended for handling multiple objectives.

The format of all of these data files is:

    number of rows (m), number of columns (n)   
    for each column j (j=1,...,n) in turn:    
        column cost for objective 1 c1(j)
        column cost for objective 2 c2(j)
        number of rows covered by j
        list of the rows covered by j


## Instances:

The data files are:
+    biodidactic
+    biosppaa01, biosppaa02, biosppaa03, biosppaa05
+    biosppnw01, biosppnw02, ... , biosppnw43
+    biorail4284

For these instances, the coefficients of the second objective are a random permutation of the coefficients of the first objective.

The set of non dominated points have been computed with [vOptGeneric](https://github.com/vOptSolver/vOptGeneric.jl) for several instances.

+ Click [![Y_N file](../img/icon/dl-z.png "Y_N file")](Y/) to access these files

The format of all of these files is:

    CPU time   
    number of non-dominated points (K)
    for each non-dominated point (k=1,...,K) in turn:
        value on the 1st objective, z1(k)
        value on the 2nd objective, z2(k)
