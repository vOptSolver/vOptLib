# Multiobjective linear assigment problem (LAP)
	
## Definition

The linear assigment problem with p linear objectives is defined as follow:

    Min sum{i=1,…,n;j=1,…,n} c^{k}_{i,j} x_{i,j}    for k = 1,…,p
    s/t sum{i=1,…,n} x_{i,j} = 1                    for j = 1,…,n
        sum{j=1,…,n} x_{i,j} = 1                    for i = 1,…,n
        x_{i,j} = 0 or 1             for i = 1,…,n, for j = 1,…,n
