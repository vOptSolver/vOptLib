# UFLP: the series

There are currently 35 data files.


## Format
All the values are integers. The format of these data files is:

    number of users (nI)
    number of services (nJ)
    blank line    
    costs for objective 1 c1(i,j) as a matrix with nI lines and nJ columns
    blank line
    costs for objective 2 c2(i,j) as a matrix with nI lines and nJ columns
    blank line
    costs for objective 1 r1(j) as a vector with nJ values
    blank line
    costs for objective 2 r2(j) as a vector with  nJ values

## Instances:

The series F is has been created by Elena Fernandez.
The collection has been generated in pasting two mono-objective UFLP.
+ size :  nI=90 and nJ=30
+ correlation of objectives : near 0.0

The series H is has been created by Irina Harris and Christine Mumford.
The collection comes from a green logistic project (objective 1 = costs; objective 2 = CO2).
+ size :  nI=2000 to 10000 and nJ=10
+ correlation of objectives : near 0.99

The data files are:
+    didactic1, didactic2
+    F50-51, ... , F56-57
+    H10-2000, ... , H10-10000
